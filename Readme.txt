This is a javascript re-creation of my favorite card game, SET!

To play set, you try and find a "SET" of three cards before your opponent. A set is three cards that has each card attribute either all the same or all different. Card attributes are: color, shape, number of shapes, and fill. 

So, a set could have all red, all diamonds, but 1,2,3 as the numbers, and three different fills. When you see a set of three, shout out "SET!" or hit your designated button, and click on the three cards that make up a set. If you're right, you keep the cards and get three points. If you're wrong, you have to give one card back to the pile. 

The dealer deals out 9 cards at a time, and you keep going until the deck is out.
